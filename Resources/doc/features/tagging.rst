Tagging
=======

**Works with**:

* :ref:`Varnish <foshttpcache:varnish_tagging>`
* :ref:`Symfony <foshttpcache:symfony_httpcache_tagging>`
* Fastly

If your application has many intricate relationships between cached items,
which makes it complex to invalidate them by route, cache tagging will be
useful. It helps you with invalidating many-to-many relationships between
content items.

Cache tagging, or more precisely `Tagged Cache Invalidation`_, a simpler
version of `Linked Cache Invalidation`_ (LCI), allows you to:

* assign tags to your applicationsâ€™s responses (e.g., ``articles``, ``article-42``)
* :ref:`invalidate the responses by tag <foshttpcache:tags>` (e.g., invalidate
  all responses that are tagged ``article-42``)

.. hint::

    When working with Varnish, it is recommended to use the xkey vmod for
    efficient invalidation. See :ref:`Tagging with Varnish <foshttpcache:varnish_tagging>`
    and :ref:`configure the proxy client for purgekeys <config_varnish_tag_mode>`.

Basic Configuration
-------------------

First configure your proxy for tagging (:ref:`Varnish <foshttpcache:varnish_tagging>`,
:ref:`Symfony <foshttpcache:symfony_httpcache_tagging>`) and see if you want to
adjust anything in the :doc:`proxy client configuration </reference/configuration/proxy-client>`.
Then enable tagging in your application configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

    fos_http_cache:
        tags:
            enabled: true

For more information, see :doc:`/reference/configuration/tags`.

Setting and Invalidating Tags
-----------------------------

You can tag responses in different ways:

* From PHP code by using the response tagger to set tags and the cache manager
  to invalidate tags;
* Set tags from twig templates with a function;
* In project configuration or using annotations on controller actions.

You can add tags before the response object exists. The tags are automatically
added to the response by a listener. The listener also detects pending tag
invalidations and flushes them. As with other invalidation operations, tag
invalidation requests are flushed to the caching proxy
:ref:`after the response has been sent <flushing>`.

Tagging and Invalidating from PHP Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add tags to responses, use the ``ResponseTagger::addTags`` method::

    use FOS\HttpCacheBundle\Http\SymfonyResponseTagger;

    class NewsController
    {
        public function articleAction(string $id, SymfonyResponseTagger $responseTagger)
        {
            $responseTagger->addTags(array('news', 'news-' . $id));

            // ...
        }
    }

.. versionadded:: 2.3.2
    Autowiring support has been added in version 2.3.2. In older versions of
    the bundle, you need to inject the service
    ``fos_http_cache.http.symfony_response_tagger`` into your controller.

To invalidate tags, use the ``CacheManager::invalidateTags($tags)`` method::

    use FOS\HttpCacheBundle\CacheManager;

    class NewsController
    {
        /**
         * @var CacheManager
         */
        private $cacheManager;

        public function editAction(string $id, CacheManager $cacheManager)
        {
            // ...

            $cacheManager->invalidateTags(array('news-' . $id));

            // ...
        }
    }

.. versionadded:: 2.3.2
    Autowiring support has been added in version 2.3.2. In older versions of
    the bundle, you need to inject the service ``fos_http_cache.cache_manager``
    in your controller.

Tagging from Twig Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In situations where a page is assembled in the templating layer, it can be more
convenient to add tags from inside the template. This works the same way as
with the response tagger and can also be mixed with the other methods:

.. code-block:: jinja

    {# template.html.twig #}
    {{ fos_httpcache_tag('mytag') }}
    {{ fos_httpcache_tag(['tag-one', 'tag-two']) }}

.. hint::

    This twig function never outputs anything into the template but is only
    called for the side effect of adding the tag to the response header.

.. note::

    Tag invalidation from twig would be a strange architecture and is therefore
    not supported.

Tagging and Invalidating with Configuration Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alternatively, you can :doc:`configure rules </reference/configuration/tags>`
for setting and invalidating tags:

.. code-block:: yaml

    // app/config/config.yml
    fos_http_cache:
        tags:
            rules:
                -
                    match:
                        path: ^/news/article
                    tags: [news]

Now if a :term:`safe` request matches the criteria under ``match``, the response
will be tagged with ``news``. When an unsafe request matches, the tag ``news``
will be invalidated.

Tagging and Invalidating with Controller Annotations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add the ``@Tag`` annotations to your controllers to set and invalidate tags::

    use FOS\HttpCacheBundle\Configuration\Tag;

    class NewsController
    {
        /**
         * @Tag("news", expression="'news-'~id")
         */
        public function articleAction($id)
        {
            // Assume $id equals 123
        }
    }

If ``articleAction`` handles a :term:`safe` request, a tag ``news-123`` is set
on the response. If a client tries to update or delete news article 123 with an
unsafe request to ``articleAction``, such as POST or DELETE, tag ``news-123``
is invalidated.

See the :ref:`@Tag reference <tag>` for full details.
