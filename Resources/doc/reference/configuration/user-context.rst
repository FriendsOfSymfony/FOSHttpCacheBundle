User Context
------------

This chapter describes how to configure user context caching. See
:doc:`/features/user-context` for an introduction to user context caching.

User context requests are a way to cache content that depends on some
permissions but is not fully individual.

.. note::

    Please read the :ref:`user context <foshttpcache:user-context>`
    chapter in the FOSHttpCache documentation before continuing.

This bundle provides an *event subscriber* for the context. It aborts
requests for the context hash right after the security firewall was applied and
replies with the hash in the header (by default ``X-User-Context-Hash``). All
other responses are set to vary on the hash header.

Additionally, the bundle provides a service that builds the user context hash
from context providers.

Configuration
-------------

First you need to set up your caching proxy as explained in the
:ref:`user context documentation <foshttpcache:user-context>`.

Then add the route you specified in the hash lookup request to the Symfony2
routing configuration, so that the user context event subscriber can get
triggered:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/routing.yml
    user_context_hash:
      /user-context-hash

.. note::

    This route is never actually used, as the context event subscriber will act
    before a controller would be called. But the user context is handled only
    after security happened. Security in turn only happens after the routing.
    If the routing does not find a route, the request is aborted with a "not
    found" error and the listener is never triggered.

    The event subscriber has priority ``7`` which makes it act right after the
    security listener which has priority ``8``. The reason to use a listener
    here rather than a controller is that many expensive operations happen
    later in the handling of the request. Having this listener avoids those.

.. caution::

    If you are using `Symfony2 security <http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/security.html>`_
    for the hash generation, make sure that this route is inside the firewall
    for which you are doing the cache groups.

Enable the subscriber with the default settings:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml
    fos_http_cache:
      user_context:
        enabled: true

.. note::

    The user context is automatically enabled if you configure any of the
    ``user_context`` options.

Tweaking the Naming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure a couple of things:

* ``hash_header``: The header that will be used to communicate the context hash
  in the answer to the context hash request, and that every other response will
  ``Vary`` on;
* ``match.accept``, ``match.method``: Criteria to detect the request for getting
  the context hash. You can set ``accept`` to configure the ``Accept`` header and
  the ``method`` to configure the HTTP method;
* ``match.matcher_service``: Instead of defining the accept header or HTTP
  method, can specify your own matcher service implementing
  ``Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\RequestMatcherInterface``. If you do, the
  other options in the ``match`` section are ignored.

The configuration with the *default values* looks like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml
    fos_http_cache:
      user_context:
        hash_header: X-User-Context-Hash
        match:
          id: fos_http_cache.user_context.request_matcher
          accept: 'application/vnd.fos.user-context-hash'
          # could be HEAD or GET
          method: ~

.. important::

    Remember that you need to make your caching proxy configuration correspond
    to these values.

Context Hash Request Cache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Context hash responses can be configured with a time to live (ttl) and ``Vary``
information. Usually it is enough to set ``hash_cache_ttl``. But if you use other
headers than ``Authorization`` and ``Cookies``, you need to also configure the
``user_identifier_headers`` to list all headers the context depends on.

If the hash only depends on the ``Authorization`` header and should be cached for
15 minutes, configure:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml
    fos_http_cache:
      user_context:
        user_identifier_headers:
          - Authorization
        hash_cache_ttl: 900

You will need to invalidate this cache when the user context will change (e.g. on
login, logout, ...)

With the default configuration of security in Symfony, the session id is regenerated
for the login and logout action. You have to be sure that the ``invalidate_session``
configuration key is set to true in your firewall configuration.

To invalidate the cache on the caching proxy, a logout handler named
``fos_http_cache.user_context.logout_handler`` can be add in your firewall.
Your caching proxy needs to support BAN operations for this to work.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/security.yml
    security:
      firewalls:
        secured_area:
          logout:
            invalidate_session: true
            handlers:
              - fos_http_cache.user_context.logout_handler

This handler will automatically send requests to ban the hash cache of the user
on logout.

The User Context
----------------

When a context hash request is received, a ``HashGenerator`` is used to build
the context information. You can implement your own providers or configure the
provided role provider that adds the Symfony roles of the current user.

Role Provider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the most common scenarios is to differentiate the content based on the
roles of the user. This bundle provides a service for this. It is disabled by
default. Enable it with:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml
    fos_http_cache
      user_context:
        role_provider: true

If there is a security context that can provide the roles, all roles are added
to the hash.

Implement a Custom Context Provider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Custom providers need to:

* implement ``FOS\HttpCache\UserContext\ContextProviderInterface``
* be tagged with ``fos_http_cache.user_context_provider``.

The ``updateUserContext`` method is called when the hash needs to be generated.

.. code-block:: yaml

    acme.demo_bundle.my_service:
      class: "%acme.demo_bundle.my_service.class%"
      tags:
        - { name: fos_http_cache.user_context_provider }

.. code-block:: xml

    <service id="acme.demo_bundle.my_service" class="%acme.demo_bundle.my_service.class%">
        <tag name="fos_http_cache.user_context_provider" />
    </service>
