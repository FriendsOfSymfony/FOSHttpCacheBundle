cache_control
=============

The configuration contains a number of *rules*. When a request matches the
parameters described in the ``match`` section, the headers as defined under
``headers`` will be set on the response, if they are not already set. Rules are
checked in the order specified, where the first match wins.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml
    fos_http_cache:
        cache_control:
            rules:
                # only match login.example.com
                -
                    match:
                        host: ^login.example.com$
                    headers:
                        cache_control:

                    headers:
                        cache_control:

                -

                            last_modified: "-1 hour"

rules
-----

**type**: ``array``

A set of cache control rules consisting of *match* criteria and *header* instructions.

.. include:: /includes/match.rst

headers
^^^^^^^

**type**: ``array``

.. sidebar:: YAML alias for same headers for different matches

    If you have many rules that should end up with the same headers, you
    can use YAML "aliases" *within the same configuration file* to avoid
    redundant configuration. The ``&alias`` notation creates an alias, the
    ``<< : *alias`` notation inserts the aliased configuration. You can then
    still overwrite parts of the aliased configuration. An example would be:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        rules:
            -
                match:
                    path: ^/products.*
                headers: &public
                    cache_control:
                        public: true
                        max_age: 600
                        s_maxage: 300
                    reverse_proxy_ttl: 3600
            -
                match:
                    path: ^/brands.*
                headers:
                    << : *public
                    cache_control:
                        max_age: 1800

In the ``headers`` section, you define what headers to set on the response if
the request was matched.

Headers are **merged**. If the response already has certain cache directives
set, they are not overwritten. The configuration can thus specify defaults
that may be changed by controllers or services that handle the response, or
``@Cache`` annotations.

The listener that applies the rules is triggered at priority 10, which
makes it handle before the ``@Cache`` annotations from the
SensioFrameworkExtraBundle are evaluated. Those annotations unconditionally
overwrite cache directives.

The only exception is responses that *only* have the ``no-cache``
directive. This is the default value for the cache control and there is no
way to determine if it was manually set. If the full header is only
``no-cache``, the whole cache control is overwritten.

You can prevent the cache control on specific requests by injecting the
service ``fos_http_cache.event_listener.cache_control`` and calling
``setSkip()`` on it. If this method is called, no cache rules are applied.

cache_control
"""""""""""""

**type**: ``array``

The map under ``cache_control`` is set in a call to ``Response::setCache()``.
The names are specified with underscores in yml, but translated to ``-`` for
the ``Cache-Control`` header.

You can use the standard cache control directives:

* ``max_age`` time in seconds;
* ``s_maxage`` time in seconds for proxy caches (also public caches);
* ``private`` true or false;
* ``public`` true or false;
* ``no_cache`` true or false (use exclusively to support HTTP 1.0);

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml
    fos_http_cache:
        cache_control:
            rules:
                -
                    headers:
                        cache_control:
                            public: true
                            max_age: 64000
                            s_maxage: 64000

If you use ``no_cache``, you should *not set any other options*. This will make
Symfony properly handle HTTP 1.0, setting the ``Pragma: no-cache`` and
``Expires: -1`` headers. If you add other cache_control options, Symfony will
not do this handling. Note that Varnish 3 does not respect ``no-cache`` by
default. If you want it respected, add your own logic to ``vcl_fetch``.

.. note::

    The cache-control headers are described in detail in :rfc:`2616#section-14.9`.

Extra Cache Control Directives
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

You can also set headers that Symfony considers non-standard, some coming from
RFCs extending HTTP/1.1. The following options are supported:

* ``must_revalidate`` (:rfc:`2616#section-14.9`)
* ``proxy_revalidate`` (:rfc:`2616#section-14.9`)
* ``no_transform`` (:rfc:`2616#section-14.9`)
* ``stale_if_error``: seconds (:rfc:`5861`)
* ``stale_while_revalidate``: seconds (:rfc:`5861`)

The *stale* directives need a parameter specifying the time in seconds how long
a  cache is allowed to continue serving stale content if needed. The other
directives are flags that are included when set to true.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml
    fos_http_cache:
        cache_control:
            rules:
                -
                    path: ^/$
                    headers:
                        cache_control:
                            stale_while_revalidate: 9000
                            stale_if_error: 3000
                            must_revalidate: true
                            proxy_revalidate: true
                            no_transform: true

last_modified
"""""""""""""

**type**: ``string``

The input to the ``last_modified`` is used for the ``Last-Modified`` header.
This value must be a valid input to ``DateTime``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml
    fos_http_cache:
        cache_control:
            rules:
                -
                    headers:
                        last_modified: "-1 hour"

.. hint::

    Setting an arbitrary last modified time allows clients to send
    ``If-Modified-Since`` requests. Varnish can handle these to serve data
    from the cache if it was not invalidated since the client requested it.

vary
""""

**type**: ``string``

You can set the `vary` option to an array that defines the contents of the
`Vary` header when matching the request. This adds to existing Vary headers,
keeping previously set Vary options.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml
    fos_http_cache:
        cache_control:
            rules:
                -
                    headers:
                        vary: My-Custom-Header

reverse_proxy_ttl
"""""""""""""""""

**type**: ``integer``

Set a X-Reverse-Proxy-TTL header for reverse proxy time-outs not driven by ``s-maxage``.

By default, reverse proxies use the ``s-maxage`` of your ``Cache-Control`` header
to know how long it should cache a page. But by default, the s-maxage is also
sent to the client. Any caches on the internet, for example at an internet
provider or in the office of a surfer, might look at ``s-maxage`` and
cache the page if it is ``public``. This can be a problem, notably when you do
:doc:`explicit cache invalidation </reference/cache-manager>`. You might want your reverse
proxy to keep a page in cache for a long time, but outside caches should not
keep the page for a long duration.

One option could be to set a high ``s-maxage`` for the proxy and simply rewrite
the response to remove or reduce the ``s-maxage``. This is not a good solution
however, as you start to duplicate your caching rule definitions.

This bundle helps you to build a better solution: You can specify the option
``reverse_proxy_ttl`` in the headers section to get a special header that you can
then use on the reverse proxy:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml
    fos_http_cache:
        cache_control:
            rules:
                -
                    headers:
                        reverse_proxy_ttl: 3600
                        cache_control:
                            public: true
                            s_maxage: 60

This example adds the header ``X-Reverse-Proxy-TTL: 3600`` to your responses.
Varnish by default knows nothing about this header. To make this solution work,
you need to extend your varnish ``vcl_fetch`` configuration:

.. code-block:: c

    sub vcl_fetch {
        if (beresp.http.X-Reverse-Proxy-TTL) {
            C{
                char *ttl;
                ttl = VRT_GetHdr(sp, HDR_BERESP, "\024X-Reverse-Proxy-TTL:");
                VRT_l_beresp_ttl(sp, atoi(ttl));
            }C
            unset beresp.http.X-Reverse-Proxy-TTL;
        }
    }

Note that there is a ``beresp.ttl`` field in VCL but unfortunately it can only
be set to absolute values and not dynamically. Thus we have to revert to a C
code fragment.
