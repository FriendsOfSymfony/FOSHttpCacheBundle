proxy_client
============

The proxy client sends invalidation requests to your caching proxy. The
:doc:`Cache Manager </reference/cache-manager>` wraps the proxy client and is
the usual entry point for application interaction with the caching proxy.

You need to configure a client or define your own service for the cache manager
to work.

The proxy client is also directly available as a service
(``fos_http_cache.proxy_client.default`` and ``fos_http_cache.proxy_client.varnish``
, ``fos_http_cache.proxy_client.nginx`` or ``fos_http_cache.proxy_client.symfony``)
that you can use directly.

If you need to adjust the proxy client, you can also configure the ``CacheManager``
with a :ref:`custom proxy client <custom_proxy_client>` that you defined as a
service. In that case, you do not need to configure anything in the
``proxy_client`` configuration section.

varnish
-------

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml
    fos_http_cache:
        proxy_client:
            varnish:
                servers: 123.123.123.1:6060, 123.123.123.2
                base_url: yourwebsite.com

``servers``
"""""""""""

**type**: ``array``

Comma-separated list of IP addresses or host names of your
caching proxy servers. The port those servers will be contacted
defaults to 80; you can specify a different port with ``:<port>``.

When using a multi-server setup, make sure to include **all** proxy servers in
this list. Invalidation must happen on all systems or you will end up with
inconsistent caches.

``base_url``
""""""""""""

**type**: ``string``

The hostname (or base URL) where users access your web application. The base
URL may contain a path. If you access your web application on a port other than
80, include that port:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml
    fos_http_cache:
        proxy_client:
            varnish:
                base_url: yourwebsite.com:8000

.. warning::

    Double-check ``base_url``, for if it is mistyped, no content will be
    invalidated.

See the :ref:`FOSHttpCache library docs <foshttpcache:varnish configuration>`
on how to configure Varnish.

nginx
-----

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml
    fos_http_cache:
        proxy_client:
            nginx:
                servers: 123.123.123.1:6060, 123.123.123.2
                base_url: yourwebsite.com
                purge_location: /purge

For ``servers`` and ``base_url``, see above.

``purge_location``
""""""""""""""""""

**type**: ``string``

Separate location that purge requests will be sent to.

See the :ref:`FOSHttpCache library docs <foshttpcache:nginx configuration>`
on how to configure Nginx.

symfony
-------

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml
    fos_http_cache:
        proxy_client:
            symfony:
                servers: 123.123.123.1:6060, 123.123.123.2
                base_url: yourwebsite.com

For ``servers`` and ``base_url``, see above.

default
-------

**type**: ``enum`` **options**: ``varnish``, ``nginx``, ``symfony``

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml
    fos_http_cache:
        proxy_client:
            default: varnish

If there is only one proxy client, it is automatically the default. Only
configure this if you configured more than one proxy client.

The default proxy client that will be used by the cache manager. You can
*configure Nginx, Varnish and Symfony proxy clients in parallel*. There is
however only one cache manager and it will only use the default client.

Custom HTTP Client
------------------

The proxy client uses a ``Http\Client\Utils\HttpMethodsClient`` wrapping a
``Http\Client\HttpClient`` instance. If you need to customize the requests, for
example to send a basic authentication header with each request, you can
configure a service for the ``HttpClient`` and specify that in the
``http_client`` option of any of the cache proxy clients.

Caching Proxy Configuration
---------------------------

You need to configure your caching proxy (Varnish or Nginx) to work with this
bundle. Please refer to the :ref:`FOSHttpCache libraryâ€™s documentation <foshttpcache:proxy-configuration>`
for more information.
