Changelog
=========

1.3.14
------

* User context compatibility which was broken due to Symfony making responses
  private if the session is started as of Symfony 3.4+.

1.3.13
------

* Symfony HttpCache User Context: Move the AnonymousRequestMatcher to FOSHttpCache.

  The recommended way to ignore cookie based sessions is to set `session_name_prefix` to
  false rather than omit the Cookie header from `user_identifier_headers`.

1.3.12
------

* Prevent potential accidental caching on user context hash mismatch (particularly with symfony HttpCache).

1.3.11
------

* #395 : Compatibility with SensioFrameworkExtraBundle 4.

1.3.10
------

* Avoid calling deprecated method in Symfony 3.2.

1.3.9
-----

* Fix configuration handling when only custom proxy client is configured.

1.3.8
-----

* Do not sanity check hash on anonymous requests.

1.3.7
-----

* Add a sanity check on UserContextHash to avoid invalid content being cached
  (example: anonymous cache set for authenticated user). This scenario occures
  when the UserContextHash is cached by Varnish via 
  `fos_http_cache.user_context.hash_cache_ttl` > 0 and the session is lost via 
  garbage collector. The data given is the anonymous one despite having a hash 
  for authenticated, all authenticated users will then have the anonymous version.
  Same problem could occurs with users having is role changed or anything else
  that can modify the hash.

1.3.2
-----

* Fixed some status codes (such as 204 and 302) not triggering invalidation.

1.3.1
-----

* Fixed configuration handling with symfony and nginx cache client. Cache
  tagging is now immediately reported to not work with those clients.

1.3.0
-----

* Added configuration for Symfony HttpCache client and HttpCache now loads
  purge and refresh handlers by default.
* Configured/annotated cache tags on subrequests (in Twig: `render(controller())`)
  are no longer ignored. Additionally, it is now possible to add tags from code
  before the response object has been created, by using the TagHandler, and from
  Twig with the `fos_httpcache_tag` function.
  If you defined custom services for the `InvalidateTagCommand`, you should
  now inject the TagHandler instead of the CacheManager.
* **deprecated** `CacheManager::tagResponse` in favor of `TagHandler::addTags`
* Added configuration option for custom proxy client (#208)
* Added support for a simple Etag header in the header configuration (#207)

1.2.0
-----

* Refactored the Symfony built-in HttpCache support to be extensible.
  `FOS\HttpCacheBundle\HttpCache` is deprecated in favor of `EventDispatchingHttpCache`.

  BC break: If you overwrite cleanupForwardRequest in your cache kernel, you need to
  extend FOS\HttpCache\SymfonyCache\UserContextSubscriber and move that logic to the
  method cleanupHashLookupRequest in there.

1.1.0
-----

* Allow cache headers overwrite.
* Added support for the user context lookup with Symfony built-in reverse
  proxy, aka `HttpCache`.

1.0.0
-----
